    <textOnly>Hello {!Contact.FirstName},

This is just a note to say thank you for your business with us over the years. 

Believe it of not, today is the anniversary of when we started working together. I would like to setup a meeting to review how we are doing, and to ensure we are meeting your needs as they stand today. Would you be open to that?

I look forward to talking to you soon.

Sincerely,

{!Contact.OwnerFullName}
